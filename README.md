# A Deep Dive into LLM Text Preprocessing

This repository provides a hands-on guide to the essential text preprocessing pipeline required for building Large Language Models (LLMs). It breaks down the journey from raw text to model-ready tensors through clear, commented Python code.

## The Importance of Preprocessing

Before a Large Language Model can learn from text, the raw characters must be converted into a numerical format it can understand. This multi-stage process, known as preprocessing, is the foundational first step in any NLP project. This repository explores the key stages of this pipeline.

## Key Preprocessing Stages Demonstrated

This project is organized to demonstrate the critical steps of turning text into a format suitable for a model like GPT.
